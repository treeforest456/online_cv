  - project:
    title: Airbnb New User Bookings (Kaggle)
    link: "#hook"
    tagline: "<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Used data provided by Airbnb to predict in which country a new user will make his or her first booking</li>
      <li>Cleaned raw data set to make it easier to handle for models, extracted features from numerical data as well as
categorical data, creating new features by performing interactions between columns</li>
      <li>Determined the most important feature by extracting the day of the year from date column, used XGBoost
model to improve the accuracy by 30%. Got NDCG score at 0.866</li>
    </ul>"
  - project:
    title: Identify Fraud from Enron Email
    link: "#"
    tagline: "<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Dealt with numerical data with imbalanced label set, outliers and NaN; the objective was identifying whether
an individual is a fraud or not</li>
      <li>Performed outlier detection, filling NaN, upsampling, numerical data scaling in preprocessing phase; created
up to 703 features from 19 features and performed feature selection using feature importance</li>
      <li>Chose Top 8 features added to the original set; tuned decision tree classifier after compared 8 algorithms, got
0.82 accuracy, precision and recall were both improved by 20%</li>
    </ul>"
  - project:
    title: Two Sigma Connect - Rental Listing Inquiries (Kaggle)
    link: "#"
    tagline: "<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Predicted the interest level of the listings given data set including numerical, categorical, text and image data</li>
      <li>Used multi-ways interaction among columns to create new important features, extracted both new numerical
and categorical features from text data</li>
      <li>Tuned XGBoost model to fit the training data and made sure it was not overfitting by using cross validation</li>
    </ul>"
  - project:
    title: OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling
    link: "#"
    tagline: "<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Downloaded 419MB raw XML format data from OpenStreetMap.org about St. Louis, cleaned and reshaped
the raw data with Python with Pandas and CSV packages</li>
      <li>Imported the 5 cleaned CSV file into MySQL to do analysis; performed multiple queries to find insights and
extra ideas about the dataset</li>
      <li>Listed 3 extra ideas, and pros and cons for each of them, about improving the data quality; listed additional
explorations about the local items of interest, such as amenities and cuisines</li>
    </ul>"
  - project:
    title: Sentiment Analysis with an RNN
    link: "#"
    tagline: "<br />
    <ul>
      <li>In data preprocessing phase, removed punctuations, encoded words into integers, truncated paragraphs to the
same length in numpy array</li>
      <li>Built embedding layer and LSTM layer with TensorFlow, used dropout technique to avoid overfitting, and
added a fully connected layer at the end with sigmoid function as a classifier, using MSE as the metric</li>
      <li>Split dataset into training, validation and test set, trained 10 epochs, and achieved 0.85 accuracy score on test
set</li>
    </ul>"
